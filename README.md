# PokemonSite
I'll be using my final project from my Cloud Computing Class
The project was able to compare 2 pokemon, and I'll consider it one of a couple tools I would like to build

# To-Do
-Add a homepage to the site where users can naviagte to different tools
-Add a CSS theme that can be used for each page. Add a bar at the top that can bring users to the homepage. Add a footer.
-Update dataset to include generation 8 Pokemon
-Add teambuilding tool that I've been planning. This will be a big task

# Build
We will be using Heroku
